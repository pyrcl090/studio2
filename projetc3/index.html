                <p>In the initial recording of this project, I used simple devices:<br>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[analog]<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pencil<br>

                <p>As I projected my recording the initial recording of my project was distorted in two ways:
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[meaning]<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the object's meaning and significance was distorted as the presentation displayed it as a set of data points to be taken account of.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paper<br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[size]<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the pysical size of the object which was a small drawing became extremely large once projected.<br>
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Playback -->
            <div class="projet play1">playback +</div>
            <div class="projet play2 cache">
                <p>During the playback, I drew from the ideas of the size distortion, and loss of meaning, and created an extremely small digital receipt in the form of a noodle, creating a different perception of the initial observation.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal for my playback is for me to loose control of the recording in the same way I do digitally.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this to occur I ask that input be created from my peers. The input can be an observation from my presentation, your mood, another piece of something, anything pertaining to the situation. 
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relinquishing control there is a mechanism [all those that participate and the devices they use] that input information to further distorting, and creating a new.
