       The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV<br><br>
       The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an 
      indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, 
      with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings. 
      From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper 
      and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable. 
      Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except 
      two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely 
      exceeds that of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow 
      hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to 
      all the rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two very 
      small closets. In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, 
      satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral stairway, 
      which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. In the hallway 
      there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men usually 
      infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why
      this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces
      represent and promise the infinite... Light is provided by some spherical
      fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed,
      in each hexagon. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant. </p>
