       The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV<br><br>
       The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an <em>
       indefinite</em> and perhaps <em>infinite</em> number of hexagonal 
       galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings. 
       From any of the hexagons one can see, <em>interminably</em>, the upper and
       lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is <em>invariable</em>. 
       Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except 
       two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely
       exceeds that of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow 
       hallway which opens onto another gallery, <em>identical</em> to the first 
       and to all the rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two 
       very small closets. In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other,
       satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral stairway,
       which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. In the hallway 
       there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men usually 
       infer from this mirror that the Library is not <em>infinite</em> (if it were,
       why this <em>illusory</em> duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished 
       surfaces represent and promise the <em>infinite</em>... Light is provided by 
       some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally
       placed, in each hexagon. The light they emit is <em>insufficient, incessant</em>.
